# RESOURCES

Whether it's your first or fiftieth *Pull Request*, there's always more to learn!
We've put together some resources that can help you create quality *Pull Requests*,
keep your repositories spotless and develop your knowledge in *open source*.

## Values

Inspired by you - the community -, by your actions and stories.

1. **Everyone is welcome!** Participants at Hacktoberfest represent 151 countries and
thousands of unique skill sets. This program welcomes everyone who already
part of the *open source software* community, and everyone who is interested in joining.

2. **Quantity is fun, quality is the key** Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth,
professional opportunities and community building. However, it all starts with significant contributions
for *open source software*

3. **Short-term action, long-term impact** In the *open source software* community, we support each other
on the shoulders of those who came before us. Your participation will have a lasting effect on people and the
technology after October. This is a journey, not a race.

## Starting with Hacktoberfest

We encourage all participants to read all the details to ensure that the global community
work towards a common goal. We thank you for honoring the values and following the rules of participation.

## Participation details

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you're an experienced contributor
or are looking for projects to contribute for the first time, feel free to participate.
- *Pull request* requests can be made in any repository or project hosted on GitHub.
As long as the project is **public** and **hosted on GitHub**, your *pull request* requests will count
for your participation (note: *there are new requirements, see the
[section on updating the rules] (#UPDATING-OF-PARTICIPATION RULES)*)
- You can sign up anytime between October 1st and October 31st. Just make sure you register
on the official website [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) so that your requests for
*pull request* are counted.

## Rules of participation

To win an official event t-shirt, you must make at least four * pull requests * (PRs) between the
**1st and 31st of October** in any time zone. ~~ PR requests can be made to any
**public repository** on GitHub, not just featured repositories. ~~
([see updated rules](#UPDATE-OF-PARTICIPATION RULES))

The *pull request* must contain *commits* of your own. If a maintainer reports your request
of *pull request* as *spam*, it will not count towards your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a person
maintainer to report behavior that does not comply with the project's code of conduct, you may not
participate.

This year, the first 70,000 participants can win a [t-shirts](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).

## Quality standards

According to value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is the key), we provide examples of  pull requests*
that we consider low quality contributions (which we discourage).

- *Pull requests* that are automated (example: opening *pull requests* with *script* to remove spaces in
white / correct typos / optimize images).
- *Pull requests* that are disruptive (example: taking someone else's *branch* / o *commit* and requesting *pull request*).
- *Pull requests* that are considered by the maintainer to be an obstacle instead of help.
- Something that is an explicit attempt to simply add +1 *pull request* to your October count.

Last but not least, a *pull request* to fix a typo is ok, but 4 *pull requests*
to remove a lost white space, no.

## We will work together to reduce spam

- *Pull Requests* considered *spam* can be labeled “invalid” or “spam” so that they are not counted.
Maintainers deal with most of the *spam* that occurs during Hacktoberfest, and we don't like spam
as much as you. If you are a maintainer, please label all requests as *pull requests spam*
sent to the repositories you maintain as ʻinvalid` or `spam` and close them. *Pull Requests* with these tags
do not count for Hacktoberfest.
- There is a fourteen-day window for reviewing all *pull requests* before they are counted
for the completion of the challenge. After a participant submits four eligible *pull requests* (ready for review,
not drafts), the window starts. This period gives maintainers time to identify and
label *pull requests* that are *spam* as invalid. If *pull requests* are not marked as invalid
in this window, it will be possible for the user to complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. If any of the *pull requests*
is labeled as invalid, the user will return to the pending state until they have four qualified *pull requests*,
and then the review period will begin again.
- Bad repositories will be deleted. In the past, we saw many repositories that encouraged participants to make
*simple pull requests* (like adding your names to a file) to quickly get a *pull request* for
complete the Hacktoberfest. Although it can be a learning tool for new employees, it goes against one of the
our core Hacktoberfest values. The **quality** of *pull requests* is **fundamental**; the quantity comes
in second place. These repositories do not encourage quality contributions and provide an unfair advantage in
completion of the Hacktoberfest challenge. We have implemented a system to block these repositories and any
*pull requests* sent to them will not be counted.

# UPDATE OF PARTICIPATION RULES

After several reports of *spam* occurring in the first days of the event, the organization of Hacktoberfest together with
Github reformulated the rules to avoid several invalid *pull requests*.

**We make Hacktoberfest* opt-in only *for projects**, that is, only repositories that actively flag
will be part of the count of the *pull requests* of the challenge.
The maintainers will be able to make this flag by adding the topic `hacktoberfest` to the repository.

This was one of the main requests of the sponsors and we hope this helps to alleviate a little
of the problems that have happened.

We will honor all *pull requests* valid prior to this change, and after October 3, 2020 at 12:00
UTC - and October 3 in all time zones - *pull requests* will only count to win the shirt or plant one
tree if they are labeled 'hacktoberfest-accepted` by a maintainer or submitted to a repository
classified with the topic 'hacktoberfest`. In the latter case, *pull requests* will also need to have been dipped,
have been approved by a sponsor or have received the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label to be
qualified. The deadline to complete, dive, receive the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label and approve is November 1st.

To illustrate the rules in a way that matches the spirit of Hacktoberfest:

``
The Pull Request counts if:

Submitted during October E
Submitted to a public repository E (
  The PR was labeled "hacktoberfest-accepted" by a sponsor OR
  Submitted to a repository that has the topic "hacktoberfest" E (
    PR has been dipped OR
    The PR was approved
  )
)
``

**Note to sponsors:** With these changes, you no longer need to unsubscribe from Hacktoberfest. Instead
addition, we invite you to classify your repository with the topic `hacktoberfest` and apply the tag
`hacktoberfest-accepted` to * pull requests * that are valid, even those that will not be dipped. We have included some
gifs below to show you how simple it is.
